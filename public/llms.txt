# QRButik

> QRButik is a Swedish web service for creating a QR-based kiosk menu that lets customers pay with Swish, aimed at sports clubs, associations, and small events.

QRButik focuses on fast setup (no app required) and a simple flow: create a kiosk, add products, print or display a QR sign, and let visitors pay with Swish. Customer-facing pages are public, while admin pages require a magic-link login. Most content is in Swedish and prices are in SEK.
